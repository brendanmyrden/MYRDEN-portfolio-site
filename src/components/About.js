            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a passionate creator within the technical worlds of Music, Blockchain and Innovation. Through the illumination of piers this unknown world of transparent communal building has come to the forefront. In pursuit of greater expansion I am deeply excited to venture into the unknown as we all approach the new horizon of computation. I face these sectors with great expectation, zeal, and focus which drive the continual exertion of force needed to actualize projects. Continuous openness and resiliance is key to achieving expansion of comprehensive knowledge. This alone is my goal and resolve.
